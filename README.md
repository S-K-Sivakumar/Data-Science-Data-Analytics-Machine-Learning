# Data-Science-Data-Analytics-Machine-Learning
This repository contains some of my data analytics and machine learning projects that showcase the application of my understanding of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Web Scraping, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis, KNN Classification, KMeans Clustering, ARIMA timeries, Natural Language Processing and more.
The file "Machine_Learning_Algorithms.ipynb" located in the "Machine_Learning_Algorithms" folder contains the machine learning algorithms I made from scratch in Jupyter Notebooks using Python.
I have more algorithms that are a work-in-progress including neural networks and learning vector quantization that I will update this file with once completed.
